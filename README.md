#Harvard Food Finder

This is a website uses a naive Bayesian classification algorithm to detect mentions of free food on Harvard mailing lists and post them online. Let's face it: there is a wealth of events at Harvard, and most of them have free food. Now, we don't support going to an event just to weasel some food out of it, but if you happen to discover an event that you're interested in, and that has awesome food... well, why not?
