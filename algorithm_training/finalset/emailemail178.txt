Election Information Session Tonight!
Hello CSA,

Our election information session tonight will be held in *Ticknor Lounge at
6 PM- 7 PM*. Please come to find out more about the different positions and
how elections will proceed. The event is not mandatory in order to run for
CSA Board, but we strongly encourage that you attend to talk to current
board members.

Regards,
HRCSA
