Abstract:   The =E2=80=9Cnormal=E2=80=9D, i.e. non-superconducting state =
of underdoped cuprate superconductors is an extremely unusual state of =
matter, widely argued to be more exotic and interesting than the high =
temperature superconducting state to which it is intimately linked. This =
normal state is characterized by a pseudogap corresponding to partially =
gapped portions of Fermi surface, and an equally confusing =
=E2=80=9CFermi arc=E2=80=9D typically described as a discontinuous locus =
of quasiparticle excitations in which for example electron cyclotron =
orbits would not be allowed. Here we show, via the introduction and =
application of a new type of quantitative photoemission-based =
spectroscopy, that most of the pseudogap and Fermi arc phenomenology is =
naturally explained as a consequence of the interplay of the temperature =
and doping dependence of a d-wave superconducting gap/pseudogap with =
various electronic scattering mechanisms which are experimentally =
deconvolved for the first time. Furthe
r, this new method allows us to accurately measure the pairing and =
pair-breaking rates across the full temperature and doping phase =
diagram, with clear implications for the mechanism of superconductivity.
