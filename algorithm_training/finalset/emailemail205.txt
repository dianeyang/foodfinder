    Dear SPS and Graduate Students,

    This week we are happy to announce that this coming Monday,
    Professor Daniel Dessau, University of Colorado
    (http://www.colorado.edu/physics/Web/directory/faculty/dessau_d.html),
    will be our guest colloquium speaker and we will continue in the
    tradition of inviting him for a conversation with our undergrads and
    graduate students over lunch in our Undergrad Study on the 2nd floor
    of Jefferson, room 251, so please come and join in with our exciting
    guest!  The date of the luncheon will be, Monday, November 26th at
    12:00 noon.  The title of his talk will be "Dynamics of Electron
    Interactions, The Origin of Fermi Arcs, and Pairing in Cuprate
    Superconductors".

    For our graduate students and those who are new to SPS, the Physics
    Department invites guest speakers and top scientists to give a
    colloquium talk every Monday afternoon, and you can
    find more details on the department website
    http://www.physics.harvard.edu/events/, you can get a sense of what
    the talk is about from the abstract below.

    In tandem to this, SPS invites the speaker to meet up with a small
    group of undergrads and graduate students over lunch so that the
    speaker can learn something about the of physics students here, and
    the students can get to know the speaker better, learn more about
    his/her research/life, and about physics programs at other
    universities. It's also a great way for fellow Physics students to
    hang out.

    We would like to show our guests that our students are very much
    interested in their research, so we would like to have at least 10
    RSVP's for lunch on Monday. So, please send your RSVP to me and
    indicate your dietary preference (meat or vegetarian) by Wednesday
    at 5:00 p.m.   I am looking forward to hearing from you!

    Here is the abstract for the colloquium talk::

    The “normal”, i.e. non-superconducting state of underdoped cuprate
    superconductors is an extremely unusual state of matter, widely
    argued to be more exotic and interesting than the high temperature
    superconducting state to which it is intimately linked. This normal
    state is characterized by a pseudogap corresponding to partially
    gapped portions of Fermi surface, and an equally confusing “Fermi
    arc” typically described as a discontinuous locus of quasiparticle
    excitations in which for example electron cyclotron orbits would not
    be allowed.

    Here we show, via the introduction and application of a new type of
    quantitative photoemission-based spectroscopy, that most of the
    pseudogap and Fermi arc phenomenology is naturally explained as a
    consequence of the interplay of the temperature and doping
    dependence of a d-wave superconducting gap/pseudogap with various
    electronic scattering mechanisms which are experimentally
    deconvolved for the first time.

    Further, this new method allows us to accurately measure the pairing
    and pair-breaking rates across the full temperature and doping phase
    diagram, with clear implications for the mechanism of superconductivity.
