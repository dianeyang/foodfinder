Undergraduate women interested in math and physics are invited to a casual
get-together - all years and levels of experience are welcome.

There will be homemade finger foods, drinks, board games, and good company!

Come as a current concentrator to give advice and meet other women
interested in math and physics, or as a prospective concentrator or
freshman to talk to some of your more-seasoned peers about the ins and outs
of the math and physics departments and courses.
