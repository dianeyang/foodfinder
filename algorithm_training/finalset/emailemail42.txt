*Hey AAA! *
*
*
*Elections for steering committee chairs will be held this year on 19th
November (Monday)! No experience is required to run for board, and every
year many new AAA members are elected to chair positions (including
freshmen).  We would highly encourage you to attend elections, if not to
run then to get to know the future AAA Board. Feel free to email any
current board members to learn about their positions, and we hope to see
you at elections!*
*
*
*Please be reminded that in order to be eligible to vote, you must stay for
the entire duration of the event. *

   their platform; candidates running as a ticket may give their speech
   together, and will have no more than 2 minutes combined.
   2. After all the speeches have been given, deliberations will be held in
   the order that the speeches were given. *Any* member of the audience may
   stand up and provide their view on why the candidate should be elected.
   Each candidate will receive 1 minutes' worth of deliberations (tickets will
   receive 2 minutes), and no audience member shall speak for more than 30
   seconds on each candidate/ticket, to give more members the chance to voice
   their opinions.
   3. Each audience will be afforded 2 votes for all committees, except for
   Secretary/Historian and Media/Technology Chair (for which each audience
   member may have one vote).
   4. Each ballot will give the audience the option to vote "no preference"
   for any position on board.
   5. To show respect for the candidates, any hecklers will be expelled
   from elections, and will not be readmitted
   6. In order to be eligible to vote, every member of the audience must
   stay for the *entire* duration of elections. We will not be allowing any
   people who arrive after 7:05pm (not Harvard time) and leave before 9:10pm
