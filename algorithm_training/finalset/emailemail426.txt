Hi Taiwanese Cultural Society!



We hope everyone is enjoying the Thanksgiving Holidays, whether it is with
friends or family! TCS has had a fantastic year so far, and we want to
thank everyone for their participation in our workshops, dinners,
Nightmarket, Big Sib Little Sib program, etc. We have had a blast throwing
these events, and we hope you have enjoyed them as well!



As we congratulate the amazing board we've had this past year, we'd like to
announce that the election for the 2013 executive board is quickly
approaching. We highly encourage anyone who is interested in a leadership
position in the Asian American community to run for a board position. It's
a great experience to meet student leaders from across campus and to plan
events for one of the campus' most active student organizations. Whether
you have social, political, cultural, or professional interests, TCS will
provide you with many opportunities to learn and grow. We hope you will
join TCS board and develop strong bonds with other students passionate
about Taiwan and Taiwanese culture.


Best,



Xing Lin & Chyi-Shin Shu
