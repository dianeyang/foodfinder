[Ventures] Get excited about Dustin Moskovitz at Hack Night TONIGHT!
Don't miss an incredible Hack Night with Asana and Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, happening tonight beginning at 9pm in Maxwell-Dworkin! If you recall one our earlier Hack Nights this semester, you heard our own Brandon Liu, who interned at Asana, tell us about their awesome Luna framework. Check out more info about Asana below:

At Asana, we are building collaborative task and project management software in an effort to re-imagine the way people manage information, and to create a new kind of software product built for the Web from the ground up. We're taking that to another level, building on some pretty sweet server-side Javascript technology and a reactive UI framework you can see demo'ed here: http://asana.com/luna . We're using this technology to build online collaboration software that feels faster and more alive than any other product on the web.

As a company, we are built to last and have an awesome culture that encourages personal growth, wellness and working as a team of peers rather than a command/control hierarchy. Past accomplishments of our team members include co-founding facebook, building android's end-to-end sync system and rebuilding facebook newsfeed.
