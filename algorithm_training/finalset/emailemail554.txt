Hey HSA!

So everyone on Harvard's campus has FREE HBO GO starting today. Please send
out this email to your House lists (and any other lists), and reply with
where you sent it. The subject line should be: *HSA and Tivli bring you HBO
GO!*

You can either forward this email, or go to this link:

copy everything into a new email. Just make sure all the images show up!

Thank you all!
