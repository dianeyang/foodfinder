Hello Ms. Su,
        I am Jack, a senior at Stuyvesant High School conducting research
on Chinese immigrants in the United States for a social science project. I
came across your Harvardcsa website and was very impressed by your nearly
one thousand members. I was wondering if you would be able to assist me in
distributing my survey link among your members. It is a very short
questionnaire, and should not take more than a couple of minutes to fill
out. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to your response.

P.S. I included the link to my survey I wish to distribute below, so you
can feel free to check it out:
