[Canuck-open] Remembrance Day with Canadian Club
Hey Canadians,

It's once again time to start thinking about Remembrance Day and Canadian
Club wanted to inform everyone of our plans to observe this important
occasion.

*Poppies:* dues-paid members should receive a poppy under their doors in
the next day or two (if not already!). If you're dues-paid and haven't
gotten a poppy, please let us know so we can bring one over right away. If
you aren't a member but still want a poppy, please come by our event in
Kirkland Grille tomorrow (8:30 pm! come!) or email a board member so you
can come pick one up.

*November 11:* Remembrance Day falls on a Sunday this year, and as always
we'll be holding a short gathering near Widener Steps to mark the day.
Please come about 15 minutes before 11:00 am; we'll read some traditional
texts and mark a moment of silence in observance of the anniversary of the
World War I armistice. This is always a really nice time to spend a minute
reflecting on sacrifices that have been made for our country; even if
you've never been, try to come by this year. If you have ideas you'd like
included in the program, feel free to email any member of board.

*Donations:* It's customary to donate money to the Canadian Legion in
exchange for the poppies they provide us; we'll be collecting donations on
the 11th to pass on to the consulate, so please bring Canadian or American
change.

Thanks everyone!

Canuck love,
The Board
