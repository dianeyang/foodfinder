Re: [anime-social] It's time for ideas for next semester!
> Gantz

First off, Gantz is a two season series (26 eps) not one season.

You need to be careful with this show, because there are two versions. 
The original is very graphic: there's a fair deal of gore and nudity. 
There was a lot of hooplah when it came out and when it was originally 
aired it got censored to shit, and most of the subsequent fansubs used 
the censored version. I believe that the US ADV DVD release is 
uncensored, but don't quote me on that.


> Haibane Renmei

As a general rule I don't really like anything Yoshitoshi ABe's had a 
hand in, but this was the one exception. Interesting premise, and the 
plot played out well. It can be slow at times though.


> Trigun

Trigun is one of those quintessential 90's shows in tone and feel, the 
first half is goofy and funny, and then the second half gets all dark 
and serious. Of all the old classics, it's one of the better ones that 
hasn't been beaten to death (ala Eva).


> Dennou Coil

This show has a bunch of interesting concepts, but I think fails on the 
execution. The whole VR / second reality thing was a cool idea, but they 
didn't really think through all the implications and the plot ends up 
with some seriously huge holes as a result. I don't feel I wasted my 
time watching it, but there's better stuff out there.
