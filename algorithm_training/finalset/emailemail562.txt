Dear AAA,

The Eugene Bell Foundation (their website can be found at:
http://www.eugenebell.org/english/?receive_data=Y) is a non-profit NGO that
is committed to fighting multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in North
Korea. EBF has been working to fight TB, which affects a third of the
country, or around 250,000 patients. The organization makes two visits to
North Korea every year and one of their main missions is treating the
patients, who must go through two years of continuous treatment. It is
crucial that each patient in treatment must receive the full two years of
treatment; if the patient fails to do so, his/her body may develop
resistance and may not respond to the general TB medicine. MDR-TB, the
result of this, has been an increasingly prevalent challenge. While EBF
strives to eradicate the disease, we still need your help!

Right now, the Human Rights in North Korea (HRiNK) is working together with
EBF to raise enough money to provide MDR-TB treatment for one patient,
whose name will be revealed at the kickoff dinner tonight. Our first
fundraising goal is to raise $2,500 by *Sunday, December 2nd*, and this
amount will cover her first year of treatment. I understand that providing
treatment for this one patient may require a lot of support from many
people. At the same time, there is a desperate need of help as patients'
lives are on the line and *we* can do so much to help.

Please come and learn more about how you can help by attending
the fundraiser kickoff dinner *tonight at 6PM at Harvard Hall 104*.
 If you are unable to attend the event tonight but are still interested in
showing your support financially, please visit our fundraising donation

Thank you for all your support, AAA!

*MDR-TB in North Korea*
Common North Korean citizens have been suffering widespread malnutrition,
starvation, and more recently, an outbreak of MDR-TB. MDR-TB is a dangerous
infectious mycobacterial disease that attacks the lungs and deteriorates
the patient's ability to breathe; it can cause high fevers, chronic coughs,
and severe weight loss. If left untreated, MDR-TB leads to death. Through
this fundraising campaign, HRiNK hopes to shed light on the urgency of the
humanitarian crisis that is happening in North Korea, and help do our part
to mitigate it by saving one North
