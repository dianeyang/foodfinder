*MDR-TB in North Korea*
Common North Korean citizens have been suffering widespread malnutrition,
starvation, and more recently, an outbreak of MDR-TB. MDR-TB is a dangerous
infectious mycobacterial disease that attacks the lungs and deteriorates
the patient's ability to breathe; it can cause high fevers, chronic coughs,
and severe weight loss. If left untreated, MDR-TB leads to death. Through
this fundraising campaign, HRiNK hopes to shed light on the urgency of the
humanitarian crisis that is happening in North Korea, and help do our part
to mitigate it by saving one North Korean's life.
