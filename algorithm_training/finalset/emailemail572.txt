Re: [anime-social] It's time for ideas for next semester!
About Terra e: we've previewed the occasional show that seems to start one
way, and then go in another direction a few eps in (production values, or
plot, or narrative shifts in character). Terra e is like this
("oh-man-adolescent-questions-dystopian-system"). It grows into something
larger than the initial concept, and it takes place over the course of
years. (A), that can influence a person's absorption of the information,
and (B), you'd probably have to decide how far in you want to go previewing.

I agree about Yoshitoshi ABe; I hated Texhnolyze the most. Ugh. On the
other hand, Haibane Renmei's that exception you don't want to miss, just
because you disliked everything else.

I think Quartz makes a good point about Dennou Coil, too: from what I've
seen of it, it's kind of an anime of "concepts." If it's disordered, that
might suck. Though, at least it beats being all didactic and preachy and
such.

Trigun: I'm up for 90's stuff as much as the next guy, but why stop there?
I don't have any suggestions at the moment, though.

No, we don't have to see Digimon; I was kind of joking there. The series
ended a some months ago, with a ridiculous battle that brought everyone
from all iterations to fight the final boss. There are two movies, though,
for that particular iteration of the series -- since you did ask.
