I wouldn't use the word "disordered", more like "infatuated". A large 
part of the show revolves around the idea of VR glasses and a sort of 
second reality. The thing is, the show is so caught up in how cool this 
sounds that it doesn't pay attention to how it would actually work in 
real life. In particular, it seems to mostly ignore the question "what 
happens if they take their glasses off?", and that hole makes many parts 
of the show difficult to swallow. I can't go into detail without giving 
away spoilers though.

In terms of "a world besides what you can see with the naked eye", I 
think the 'ghost in the shell' franchise did it much better.

Well, if people are honestly up for watching 90's shows I can come up 
with a list of decent ones. It's been my experience that most frosh 
aren't terribly interested in stuff that came out before they were 
teenagers though.
