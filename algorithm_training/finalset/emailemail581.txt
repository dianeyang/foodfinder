[AAA-open] Fwd: Win a $40 Starbucks Gift Card in 1 Minute!
Hello friends!

We would greatly appreciate it if you could spare us one minute and
complete this survey <http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/G8CPD65> (or
http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/G8CPD65). The survey studies various factors
that affect a student's GPA at Harvard and is *compl**etely anonymous*. *This
survey is intended only for upperclass students*.

You would be contributing to a great scholarly endeavor and will earn a
chance to *win a $40 Starbucks gift card* (the instructions to enter are in
the survey). And if you wish, you will be offered an exclusive privilege of
dining with our Stat 104 Team.

Best,
Stat104Team
