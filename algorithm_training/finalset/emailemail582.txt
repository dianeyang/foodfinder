[hasa-talk] Entrepreneurship in Africa Panel
Hi everyone!


I am writing to give you a heads up about a HASA event happening
on*Wednesday, December 5th
*, from *7 to 9 pm *at *Ticknor Lounge*.


My boss, Megan White Mukuria (College =9299) will be on the panel, and I
think it=92d be nice for some of you to connect (or reconnect) with her. I=
=92ve
been working with Megan since October this year, and she=92s been an
excellent mentor. Megan has been based in Nairobi for about 10 years, and
is an expert on girls=92 education and social/policy change. Running a
successful NGO is never easy, and I have constantly been inspired by her
boundless enthusiasm and complete commitment to the cause she=92s taken up.
Mostly through her hardwork, ZanaAfrica just won a HUGE grant to start
sustainable state-of-the-art sanitary towel *production* in Kenya. Kimberly
Mihayo could tell you more.


When I think of the people creating positive change on the continent right
now, she=92s one of the those that come to mind. I=92d also think of people
like Dalumuzi Mhlanga ( Deeee! ) and David Sengeh (College =9210), and
luckily they=92ll be on the panel too!


I=92d really like to encourage you all to attend, even if you aren=92t
particularly interested in any of their specific areas, or in social
entrepreneurship in general. Then again, you might have the next great idea
to save the world... you never know :)


Best,

Princess Daisy
