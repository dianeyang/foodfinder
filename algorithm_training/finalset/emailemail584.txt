[hasa-talk] Calling All Azonto Stars at Harvard!
Hi everyone!

I'm doing my final project on *Azonto *for the dance ethnography class I'm
taking! If you love dancing Azonto, are an Azonto star, have internalized
the Azonto beat, dance Azonto on your way to class, or genuinely just want
to help a sistah out, please respond to this email letting me know you'd be
willing to participate in my project! It will take place this coming
weekend and the beginning of next week. It *will not* be a big commitment,
I promise. More details to come if you say you're interested :-)

Thank you, HASA!

<3,
Gaga
