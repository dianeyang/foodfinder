[Canuck-open] Toronto/Ottawa/Montreal Schools
Hey, Canadians!

I'm looking right now for contacts at any high schools in Toronto, Ottawa,
Montreal, or the surrounding areas of any of the cities. It's for an arts
group on campus looking for opportunities during J-term, any help would be
greatly appreciated. If you have any contacts in arts organizations at your
high schools who may want to host a Harvard group, I would really
appreciate it if you could let me know. I'd love to hear from any of you.

Thanks,
Russell Horton
