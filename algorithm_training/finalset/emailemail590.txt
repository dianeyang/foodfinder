[Canaday-list] The Jury Is In: Come and See TWELVE ANGRY MEN in The
 Agassiz Theatre, December 6th-8th
[image: Inline image 1]


Twelve jurors must decide the fate of a man who allegedly murdered his
father. As each juror=92s personality and ideals of justice clash, they beg=
in
to uncover not only the truth behind the case but also the story of each
juror=92s life.

Drawing inspirations from Frank Miller (creator of 300 and Sin City), Tim
Burton, and Robert Wilson, Twelve Angry Men attempts to boldly re-interpret
the classic movie with beautiful yet bizarre aesthetics in an alternative
reality unbound from realism to reexamine the ambiguities of justice and
truth.
