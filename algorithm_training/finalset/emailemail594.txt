[SPS] Fwd: JANUARY session of the Harvard Course in Reading and
 Study Strategies for students for whom English is a non-native language

Dear Colleague,
I am writing to you with information about the special session of the 
Harvard Course in Reading and Study Strategies that the Bureau of Study 
Counsel will offer this January for students/readers for whom English is 
a non-native language. I am attaching pdf versions of an information 
sheet and a poster to circulate to help us get the word out to students 
who might be interested.
The Bureau has designed this session because, while many students for 
whom English is non-native language have taken a term-time or 
summer session of the Reading Course and have found it very useful, some 
students say they would welcome a version of the course with a focus on 
the particular concerns and needs of non-native readers.Any student is 
welcome to take any session of the course.
The information sheet I'm attaching will answer many of the questions 
you and your students might have, but please call or email me or 
Paulette Dusossoit of the Bureau (pdusossoit@bsc.harvard.edu 
<blocked::blocked::mailto:pdusossoit@bsc.harvard.edu>) if you have any 
additional questions.
Thanks for your help in publicizing this session of the Reading Course.

Take care,
Sheila M. Reindl, Ed.D.

Bureau of Study Counsel, Harvard University
