  40 STUDENTS, 30 TRAILBLAZERS, 3 DAYS


  * Take one capital city
  * Add leading young economists, engineers, artists, philosophers,
    scientists, mathematicians, teachers, sociologists, historians and
    linguists
  * Throw in thirty of the world's most compelling young entrepreneurs,
    reseachers and achievers
  * Mix together and serve

*Such was the recipe for the UA 2012 Summit*
An electric 3 day gathering of the best and brightest from across 
Ireland, the UK, North America and Asia.


 From meeting the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, to receiving their awards for 
academic excellence from the President of Ireland, the 2012 UA Winners 
turned Dublin into an elite campus of endless possibility.

They learned to problem-solve like buccaneers, weave compelling stories 
like Barack Obama, plot their futures with strategic foresight, tap 
their personal creativity and opened their minds to the multiple avenues 
they could explore as high potential undergraduates.

This year's Summit exceeded all expectation and we have no doubt that 
among our new class of UA winners lie solutions to some of the world's 
most pressing problems.


For a slice of the UA Summit action, find the 3 day line-up immortalised 
in pictures below:

        “The Undergraduate Award winners represent the foremost minds
        and new ideas emerging from the world’s third level
        institutions.  It is wonderful to see that this impressive Irish
        initiative is not only supporting these students at this
        important juncture in their lives but also gathering them here
        in Ireland.”


An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny T.D


        “All of the submissions being recognised here today are a
        reassuring reminder of the great wealth of innovative and
        imaginative talent that exists amongst our young people – the
        leaders, policy makers, scientists and artists of the future."


President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins


        *"UA has given undergrads the confidence to prove that they have
        something relevant and significant to say."*
