[Canaday-list] Harvard Crimson Survey
Hey Canaday!

The Harvard Crimson is conducting a satisfaction survey to see how we can
better distribute the newspaper to you, the readers.  The survey is only a
few questions long, and literally takes less than a minute to complete. You
can access the survey
here<https://docs.google.com/a/college.harvard.edu/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDVfNzFxeHlrUm5na203NmVheWdta2c6MQ#gid=0>.
 If you fill out the survey, you will be entered to win a $20 gift card to
Pinkberry! Thank you for your help.

Regards,

John Finnegan
