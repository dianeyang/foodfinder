Subject: Tuesday at HSPH: Learn about longitudinal diabetes care in the
Asian Community!

Hi All - I'm an '11 College grad and current second-year at the medical
school - some of us have been working on putting together this panel on
longitudinal diabetes care among Asian patients, and we thought some of you
HPS members might be interested in learning more about this in light of all
the emphasis on better longitudinal/coordinated care in recent health care
debates. The talk is open to everyone at the Harvard School of Public
Health. Feel free to email me at sophie_cai@hms.harvard.edu with any
questions.

Thanks and hope you can make it!
