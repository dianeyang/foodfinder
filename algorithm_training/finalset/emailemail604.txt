already, are attending on Monday!

Thank you.

Dear SPS and Graduate Students,

Hope you had a great Thanksgiving Break!

We are happy to announce that this coming Monday, Professor Martin 
Weitz, Bonn University 
(http://www.iap.uni-bonn.de/ag_weitz/index_en.html), will be our guest 
colloquium speaker and we will continue in the tradition of inviting him 
for a conversation with our undergrads and graduate students over lunch 
in our Undergrad Study on the 2nd floor of Jefferson, room 251, so 
please come and join in with our exciting guest!  The date of the 
luncheon will be, Monday, December 3rd at 12:00 noon.  The title of his 
talk will be "Bose-Einstein Condensation of Photons".

For our graduate students and those who are new to SPS, the Physics 
Department invites guest speakers and top scientists to give a 
colloquium talk every Monday afternoon, and you can
find more details on the department website 
http://www.physics.harvard.edu/events/, you can get a sense of what the 
talk is about from the abstract below.

In tandem to this, SPS invites the speaker to meet up with a small group 
of undergrads and graduate students over lunch so that the speaker can 
learn something about the of physics students here, and the students can 
get to know the speaker better, learn more about his/her research/life, 
and about physics programs at other universities. It's also a great way 
for fellow Physics students to hang out.

We would like to show our guests that our students are very much 
interested in their research, so we would like to have at least 10 
RSVP's for lunch on Monday. So, please send your RSVP to me and indicate 
your dietary preference (meat or vegetarian) by Friday at 5:00 p.m.   I 
am looking forward to hearing from you!

Here is the abstract for the colloquium talk::

Description Bose-Einstein condensation, the macroscopic ground state 
occupation of a system of bosonic particles below a critical 
temperature, has been observed in cold atomic gases and solid-state 
physics quasiparticles. In contrast, photons do not show this phase 
transition usually, because in Planck’s blackbody radiation the particle 
number is not conserved and at low temperature the photons disappear in 
the walls of the system. I will describe an experiment realizing a 
photon Bose-Einstein condensate in a dye-filled optical microcavity, 
which acts as a “white-wall” photon box [1]. The cavity mirrors provide 
a trapping potential and a non-vanishing effective photon mass, making 
the system formally equivalent to a two-dimensional gas of trapped 
massive bosons. Thermalization of the photon gas is reached in a number 
conserving way by repeated absorption-emission cycles in the dye 
molecules. In my talk, I will begin with a general introduction and give 
an account of current work, including recent measurements of the 
condensate statistics, and future plans of the Bonn photon gas experiment.
