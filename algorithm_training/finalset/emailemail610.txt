[AAA-open] Amazing program for high school juniors - help me spread
	the word!
 Hi Everyone,

When I was a junior in high school, I had the chance to participate in a
great program called the Bezos Scholars Program @ the Aspen Institute. It
included an all-expenses paid trip to Aspen and a chance to interact with
some really incredible people. I've been recommending it to younger friends
for the last few years, but unfortunately I'm now too old to know many high
school juniors. I wanted to pass on the information though, and hope that
if any of you have friends who are juniors in high school you can recommend
it to them. Feel free to direct any questions to me!

Thanks,
Valerie

National scholars program seeks outstanding high school juniors and
educators for a powerful leadership development and scholarship opportunity
to attend the 2013 Aspen Ideas Festival. Application deadline is February

The Bezos Scholars Program @ the Aspen Institute selects 12 public high
school juniors and 12 dynamic educators to receive a seven-day,
all-expenses-paid scholarship to attend the Aspen Ideas Festival, June 25 -
July 1, 2013. On the Aspen Institute campus, past Bezos Scholars met with
Twitter founders Biz Stone and Evan Williams, retired Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, musician Moby, and
*New York Times* columnist David Brooks, among many other notables. And for
the third consecutive year, Bezos Scholars across the U.S. will be joined
by selected students and an educator from the African Leadership Academy in
South Africa.

In addition to attending seminars, tutorials and roundtable discussions,
Bezos Scholars participate in leadership training to prepare for the
challenge ahead: Creating sustainable Local Ideas Festivals that will
transform their schools and communities in the coming year. This 4-minute
video captures the experience in Scholars' own words:
