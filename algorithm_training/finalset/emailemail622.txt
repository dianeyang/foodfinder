*Election Policies*

   1. Each candidate for President will have 1 minute 30 seconds to give a
   speech about their platform.
   2. All other candidates will have 1 minute to give a speech about their
   platform; candidates running as a ticket may give their speech together,
   and will have no more than 2 minutes combined.
   3. After all the speeches have been given, deliberations will be held in
   the order that the speeches were given. *Any* member of the audience may
   stand up and provide their view on why the candidate should be elected.
   Each candidate will receive 1 minutes' worth of deliberations (tickets will
   receive 2 minutes), and no audience member shall speak for more than 30
   seconds on each candidate/ticket, to give more members the chance to voice
   their opinions. Deliberations will only be held for contested committees.
   4. Each audience will be afforded 2 votes for all committees, except for
   Secretary/Historian and Media/Technology Chair (for which each audience
   member may have one vote).
   5. After position speeches are given and deliberations have been held,
   ballots for the individual committees will be collected. This will only
   apply to contested committees.
   6. ALL candidates should give speeches for ALL the positions they are
   running for, including drop-down positions. They will be discounted from
   the ballot if they are voted into their first-choice position, and the
   runner up will receive the nomination.
   7. Each ballot will give the audience the option to vote "no preference"
   for any position on board.
   8. To show respect for the candidates, any hecklers will be expelled
   from elections, and will not be readmitted.
   9. In order to be eligible to vote, every member of the audience must
   stay for the *entire* duration of elections. We will not be allowing any
   people who arrive after 7:05pm (not Harvard time) and leave before 9:10pm
   to fill out any ballots.
