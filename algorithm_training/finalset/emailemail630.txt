Oh oh oh. *That* show. I confused this with "Densha Otoko".

No, this show looks like it sucks big time, and everyone who was at that 
showing thought so. As Layla put it best: "The entire plot of this show 
is 'girls have bodies'". It's aimed squarely at the young teenage boy 
demographic and nothing but shallow fanservice.

To be fair, I haven't seen the entire show, I'm basing my opinion on the 
first ep we saw, all the art I've ever seen being crappy fanservice, and 
that no one over 20 seems to be a fan.

hahaha lol

Seriously though, the show has effectively no overarching plot. This 
isn't to say it's a bad thing, it just didn't do it for me.

The problem with Paradise Kiss was that when it got licensed all the 
fansub groups dropped it like a hot potato. That you can whip out your 
laptop and torrent eps doesn't help when no one's releasing them in the 
first place.

But besides PK, yes there have been a number of other instances with 
things getting stopped unexpectedly. IIRC Full Metal Panic was postponed 
by a season after the September 11th attacks because one of the first 
eps involves a plane hijacking, and more recently a lot of shows 
(Madoka, for example) were delayed by over a month because of the 
earthquake.

I'm just speaking from my experience being at MIT's anime club for 10 
years and seeing all the ways simple things can go wrong. Shit happens, 
and with all the other shows out there to choose from these days I don't 
think it's worth even the mild risk. It's not like you can't just play 
it next year or something.

:) Sure

For those of you who are new to the club, Spice and Wolf gets suggested 
at least once almost every year, but for one reason or another never 
ends up being picked. It's become something of a running joke at this point.
