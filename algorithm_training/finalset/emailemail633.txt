[Hchs-undergrad] Brunch tomorrow mandatory for Greek dancers!
*Dancing for Cultural Rhythms*:
If you are interested in dancing with the Hellenic Society for Cultural
Rhythms (Feb 23), it is* mandatory that you attend brunch tomorrow* at
12:30 in Eliot. Vas Giahos & Peter Karas are taking charge of the dancing,
and they have announcements.

**A note on my experience dancing with HCHS:*
I strongly encourage each and every one of you to dance--I can personally
say that many of us first became friends because of dance practices for
Cultural Rhythms two years ago. It's a ton of fun, an excuse to hang out
with some of the coolest people on campus (yes, I'm talking about us), and
performing on the Sanders stage is definitely an experience you'll remember
for some time. Don't be worried if you haven't Greek danced before--half of
us didn't, and we teach each other. All levels encouraged :)
