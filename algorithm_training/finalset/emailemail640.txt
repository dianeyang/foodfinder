Hi Evan,

I hope this e-mail finds you well.

We're starting to recruit PhD students in computational and applied math
this year. I am trying to seek out potential applicants from the best
places. Could you kindly help forward this to any of your classmates who
might be interested?


Thanks very much,
Lek-Heng


The University of Chicago has started a Computational and Applied
Mathematics Initiative (CAMI), housed within the Department of Statistics.

The initiative is motivated by an increasing interest in analyzing and
modeling high dimensional data, both static and dynamic, and handling very
large data sets in multiple scientific domains, which has led to an
increased flow of ideas between applied mathematics, statistics and
computation. A synergy is emerging among fields such as statistical
modeling of high dimensional data, parameter estimation, optimization,
machine learning, dynamical systems, and numerical analysis.

We invite potential PhD students interested in computational and applied
mathematics with a data analytic flavor to apply:

The CAMI faculty research interests include: bioinformatics, computational
neuroscience, environmental and spatial statistics, machine learning,
mathematical finance and econometrics, Monte Carlo methods, numerical
linear/multilinear algebra, optimization, and pattern recognition.

The University of Chicago has had a tradition in applied and comutational
mathematics education (past faculty and students include George Birkhoff,
Fisher Black, Alberto Calderon, Robert Floyd, Herman Goldstine, Richard
Hamming, Alston Householder, Tjalling Koopmans, Martin Kruskal, Harry
Markowitz, Nicolas Metropolis, Albert Tucker). The CAMI represents part of
the University's long-term goal in building on this tradition.

Please forward this to your students. They should apply to our Statistics
PhD program by 12/31/12, indicating interest in CAMI in their statement.
