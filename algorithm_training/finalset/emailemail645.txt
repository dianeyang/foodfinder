A 2004 film, acclaimed Chinese director Zhang Yimou fuses a martial arts
action-drama with a tragic romance in this elegant period piece. His
signature, the use of strong and rich colors, is again seen in this movie.
This movie features Zhang Ziyi, Andy Lau, and Takeshi Kaneshiro. Zhang
Yimou is also the director of Hero, Curse of the Golden Flower, and The
Flowers of War.

*BERRYLINE WILL BE SERVED!*
