[anime-list] Ghibli Movie Night!
Hey guys,

Next Friday (Nov. 16th, the Friday before the Harvard-Yale game) is our
next movie night, and since people expressed interest we'll be
watching a *Studio
Ghibli* film! Vote for what movie we should watch
*here<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dE5LcnkxVnVMeFBuOHlNLXNtMUltMWc6MQ#gid=0>
 *if you are thinking of coming.  :)

As for timing, right now I was thinking we'd start around 7pm, but if
people have different preferences just let us know over anime-social or
send me an e-mail.

Josh
