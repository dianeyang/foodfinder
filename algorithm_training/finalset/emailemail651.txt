[hasa-talk] *Dreamgirls is Official!*
ATTN: All!

BlackC.A.S.T. will officially be staging DREAMGIRLS in Farkas Hall during
Arts First weekend AND the 1st weekend of May :)

Auditions will be during Shopping Week of Spring Semester! The Office of
the Arts at Harvard has generously offered to bring in professional staff
to help make this show the best it could possibly be. I encourage all to
audition and help out behind the scenes as this will be an INCREDIBLE
opportunity and learning experience working in a professional theater.
