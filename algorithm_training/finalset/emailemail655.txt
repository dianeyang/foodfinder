[IOP-Announce] Apply to be chair of National Campaign!
Apply to be Chair of the IOP's National Campaign Committee!

In 2003, the IOP established the National Campaign for Political and Civic
Engagement in response to the growing number of college students who were
increasingly active in community service yet disengaging from the political
process. Since that time, we have seen young people's involvement in the
political process ebb and flow, and throughout the Institute of Politics
has been committed to working with twenty four colleges and universities
across the country dedicated to the mission of developing civic-minded and
politically engaged students. The mission is focused in three key areas:
engagement in electoral politics, helping students pursue a career in
public service, and a foundation in civic education.
