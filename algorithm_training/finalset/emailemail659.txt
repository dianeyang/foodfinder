Abstract:Bose-Einstein condensation, the macroscopic ground state occupation of a system of bosonic particles below
a critical temperature, has been observed in cold atomic gases and solid-state physics quasiparticles. In contrast, photons
do not show this phase transition usually, because in Planck’s blackbody radiation the particle number is not conserved
and at low temperature the photons disappear in the walls of the system.

I will describe an experiment realizing a photon Bose-Einstein condensate in a dye-filled optical micro cavity, which acts
as a “white-wall” photon box [1]. The cavity mirrors provide a trapping potential and a non-vanishing effective photon
mass, making the system formally equivalent to a two-dimensional gas of trapped massive bosons. Thermalization of the
photon gas is reached in a number conserving way by repeated absorption-emission cycles in the dye molecules.

In my talk, I will begin with a general introduction and give an account of current work, including recent measurements
of the condensate statistics, and future plans of the Bonn photon gas experiment.
