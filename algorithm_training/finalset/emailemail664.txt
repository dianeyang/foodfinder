Remember, applications <http://www.hackharvard.org/apply> are due on 
December 11th.

Maybe you didn't apply when the application 
<http://www.hackharvard.org/apply> was released, but now that it's

*APPLY NOW TO HACK WEEK* <http://www.hackharvard.org/apply>

What is Hack Week?
Whether you're just looking to take a weekend project to the next level 
or you want build the next Facebook, Hack Harvard teaches all the skills 
needed to create a scalable, secure, and intuitive service. Projects in 
all levels of development are welcome. In our intensive week-long 
incubator, students attend tech and biz seminars, network with 
entrepreneurs, are mentored by senior CS folk and industry gurus, and 
hang out with an awesome group of hackers and hustlers.

This year, our Hack Week is sponsored by General Catalyst, Greylock 
Partners, and the UC, so you can imagine we're going to have some cool 
speakers and resources for members.

When is Hack Week?
January 18th - 27th, 2013.

Who is eligible?
Any Harvard student is welcome to apply <http://www.hackharvard.org/apply>.

What types of projects?
Many of our projects are geared towards improving life at Harvard, but 
any technical project is welcome. We've seen bagged lunch delivery 
systems, online poker games, room reservation sites, and more! Ideas can 
be at any stage of completion (from a buggy landing page to 
multi-platform software backed by some crazy Hadoop cluster). Many but 
not all of our projects come straight out of CS50, but we aim to teach 
everyone a lot no matter what your skill level.

Why should I participate?
A few reasons:
- Learn how to use and apply a bunch of new and relevant web technologies,
- Hack alongside some of the smartest programmers at Harvard,
- Make your app secure, functional, beautiful, and maybe even 
profitable, all in a week,
- Meet tons of amazing entrepreneurs from the Boston area and beyond, and
- Show off your work at Demo Day in front of peers and investors!
