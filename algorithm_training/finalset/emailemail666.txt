/Abstract:/

Soon after the discovery of quantum mechanics it was realized why some 
solids are insulating (like diamond) and others are highly conducting 
(like graphite), even though they could be comprised of the same 
element. Now, 80 years later, the concept of insulators and metals is 
again being fundamentally revised. During the last few years, it has 
become apparent that there can be a distinct type of insulator, which 
can occur because of the topology of electronic wave functions in 
materials. The key consequence of this topological characteristic (and 
the way to distinguish a topological insulator from an ordinary one) is 
the presence of metallic electrons with helical spin texture at their 
surfaces. I will describe experiments that directly visualize these 
novel quantum states of matter and demonstrate their unusual properties 
through spectroscopic mapping with the scanning tunneling microscope 
(STM). These experiments show that the spin texture of these states 
protects them against back scattering and localization. [1] In fact, 
these states appear to penetrate through barriers that stop other 
electronic states. [2,3] I will also describe more ongoing efforts 
focused on manipulating these states with magnetism and experiments on 
new class of topological states that are protected by crystalline 
symmetry. Finally, I will describe efforts in which atomically 
fabricated nano structures are being used to create topological states 
and the hunt for novel topological edge modes that behave like Majorana 
Fermions. [4]
