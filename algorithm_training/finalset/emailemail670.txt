[AAA-open] AAA Board 2012-2013
Dear Everyone,

Thank you all for coming to elections-- it was great to see you all there,
and to hear each of the candidates give their platforms. The competition
was fierce for this years' contested tickets, and we are thrilled to
announce the incoming AAA Board 2012-2013. We would like to thank all the
candidates for coming out tonight, and congratulate new Board for their
outstanding speeches and platforms.

AAA Love,

Rachael Foo and Pamela Yau
