[anime-social] Voting for next semester's shows
So based on the discussion that took place over social, plus some talking
and more e-mail threads, we ended up getting a final list of 10:

Hellsing Ultimate (10)
Kino's Journey (13)
Mushishi (26)
Natsume's Book of Friends (13)
Spice and Wolf (13+12)
Psycho-Pass (22)
Mouryou no Hako [Box of Goblins] (13)
Terra e (24)
The Ambition of Oda Nobuna (12)
The Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere (13) *Note: this would be taken in
good fun<http://gargarstegosaurus.wordpress.com/the-horizon-on-tits-2-project/>
*

Everyone is encouraged to vote
*here<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDZZXzcybTdfaWY4czFDejBsU1F2ZWc6MA#gid=0>
 *if you're thinking of dropping by next semester - we'll watch the top
4-5. You're welcome to add more shows if you felt that something got left
out, or send an e-mail to social (or me) to see why we didn't list a
particular show here.

Best of luck finishing up the semester!
Josh

P.S. Since Eva 3.0 has been released, if an English-subbed camrip surfaces
between now and the end of the semester, an Eva marathon might take place.
I'll e-mail you guys if it comes up. :)
