[Hchs-undergrad] We're co-sponsoring Papandreou/Dukakis tomorrow!
*HCHS is officially co-sponsoring the Forum event tomorrow *
*with Papandreou and Dukakis. *
There is reserved seating for our members--if you can't find our box, ask
the ushers to point you in the right direction.

This should be a really interesting event--the former Prime Minister of
Greece and a Greek American governor who ran for President in the '80s
should have a lot to say (Dukakis is also a hoot). Hope to see many, many
of you guys there!
