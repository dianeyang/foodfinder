It all involves reaching out to your Representative or Senator's office.
It's best to call. You must be a constituent in their district for them to
save a ticket for you. You may be placed on a waiting list.

There are also ticket brokers online trying to sell tickets at very high
prices. You can try that route, but it isn't advisable.

BSA Inauguration Bus Ride

The BSA will subsidize a bus to the inauguration for those in the Boston
area interested in going to the events whether they have a ticket or not.
There will be free events in Dc during that time. Don't let not having a

paying a small fee, but the rest will be subsidized.
