Harvard's first Hip-Hop and Spoken Word class, Drama 167x, invites you to *What
it Iz. *Dorothy, Bronx raised and born, determines she desperately needs a
life beyond the inner-city walls. Her key? It's her voice. On her personal
path to stardom and self-discovery, she intersects paths of others who too
are searching for pieces of themselves: pieces of determination, respect,
confidence, and love. The story of Dorothy, the heroine, unfolds through
various hip-hop traditions *including student individual and group spoken
word pieces, song, and rap*.
