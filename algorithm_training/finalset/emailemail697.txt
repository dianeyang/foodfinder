[hasa-talk] Fundraising Ideas similar to Unos Dough Raiser
Hey Everyone,

I know Pinkberry has something similar. Does anyone know of a store in the
Square, central or even prudential center that has a similar thing.

Your response is much appreciated.

Thank you everyone.

Best,
St=E9phane
