A friend and I are starting a group on campus. Come grab some free food and
check us out next Tuesday! - Alisa :)


Developers for Development

Is your code ready to say hello to the world?


Learn how to use CS to make an impact on the world!

Meet speakers from interdisciplinary fields such as global health,
education, government, and more

to learn about current initiatives, participate in existing projects, and
work on your own ideas.


No CS background is necessary

Join us for a short meet and greet

Tuesday 12/11 8-9 PM in Ticknor Lounge.
