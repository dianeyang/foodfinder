Los 80 Son Nuestros is a play about what youth means and what it takes to
grow up. Set in Spain in the 80's it shows the hopes of the time and the
clash of traditional and modern values. The play's mix of loss, grief,
pity, anger, love and hope speaks to anyone who has searched for their
identity, wondered about their role in the world, or the meaning of it all.

*It is New Year's Eve of 1989 and in Guadarrama the old friends Cris, Jos=
=E9,
Mari =C1ngeles, Chus, Laura, Juan Gabriel and Rafa meet again in Juan Gabri=
el
and Rafa's garage. However, this time is not like other years. Recent
events cast a shadow over the party: Mari Angeles' father has been killed
in an accident, Jos=E9 has moved out of his house, and two young strangers
were attacked and one is dying in the hospital while the other is walking
around town. This night will mark the end of an era. This night will change
their lives forever.*
