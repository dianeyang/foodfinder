[hasa-talk] Meet high school kids and EAT PIZZA!
This week HSBSE is hosting a Science Day for high school students from the
Boston area. We need *YOUR* help to give these students an idea about what
it's like to be a black student in the STEM fields at Harvard.

If you're interested in sharing your experiences and having *FREE PIZZA* with
these awesome students on Wednesday, Dec. 5th from 11:45am-1:30pm, please fill
