[SPS] Fwd: did you do summer research in Astrophysics?
Dear Students,

Each year I compile a list of the astro-related research projects that our
students undertook over the summer. These can either be here at
Harvard/CfA, or elsewhere.

If you did do Astro research in summer 2012, could you please reply to tell
me the title of your project (or simply a 1-sentence description), the
location, the name of your advisor, and the name of the program or external
funding source, if any?

Thanks!

Dave Charbonneau
