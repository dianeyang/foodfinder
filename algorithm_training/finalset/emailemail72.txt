Subject: [HPRgument] Strong Writing/Research Skills for ARUSA


Dear HPR,

We've been publishing the Annual Report of the United States (ARUSA) for a
few years - it's a publication that studies the main sources of federal
expenditures and revenues.

http://hpronline.org/category/arusa/

This year, we are looking for one or two strong writers/researchers who are
current Harvard undergraduates that can also be the "face" for media
interviews. However, this is a serious time commitment over the next 6
weeks, requiring roughly 230 hours total between the writers/researchers.

There is currently a $2750 budget available for this work.

Most of the work will be front-loaded. If you are interested, please email
me at achen@college.harvard.edu and attach your resume and a brief
statement of interest.

Best,
Alex
