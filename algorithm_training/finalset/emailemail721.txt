[Ventures] Hack Night Tuesday: HBS Technical Students + Hack Week +
	ed-tech
Hey everyone,

It's the last hack night of the year. No, don't cry. We'll be back in 
January. Until then, come by Maxwell Dworkin at 9pm tomorrow (Tuesday) 
for 4 things:

  * Get feedback on and submit your HackHarvard Hack Week application
    <http://hackharvard.org/apply>
  * Hear from technical HBS students on the ventures they're founding
    (Cloudflare <http://cloudflare.com> was HBS. They do
    out-of-this-world technical stuff too.)
  * Hear from a Harvard student taking time off to work on a StartX
    <http://startx.stanford.edu> incubated ed-tech startup
  * Have delicious pizza, courtesy of General Catalyst

Sound good? See you there.

-Zach
