[Canaday-list] Quad Arts Festival on Dec. 8th
Hello creative minds and artistic souls,

I hope this finds you well. By now you should've all received invites to =
the Quad Art Festival on Facebook. Also, keep your eyes peeled for a =
preview of the event in the Crimson! =20




Just to give you all a little more detail regarding the specific =
activities for each showcased type of art:

Drawing/Painting: Will feature a Jackson Pollock-style collaborative =
project in which people will have various tools/paints to splatter and =
abstract. These individual pieces will then be combined to make one  =
large, collaborative piece which will be displayed in the SOCH or one of =
the Quad houses.=20
Sculpture/Hand-Building: There will be clay and just free-time to use =
clay and tools with an experienced sculptor leading students.=20
Jewelry-Making: Friendship bracelets, hemp bracelets, and glass beads =
for earrings, etc.=20
Design/Tinkering: A marshmallow design challenge with a prize! Students =
will form into teams of three and have a certain amount of time to build =
a stable and large structure out of marshmallows, toothpicks, and more.=20=


We've made a doodle poll for sign-ups for volunteering at the event =
which is below. If you are interested in volunteering at different =
stations during the festival, sign up on Doodle to be part of the team. =
As we mentioned before, there'll be food and lots of opportunities to do =
art, and you'd be doing your friends a big favor by sharing your talent =
with them.=20

Also, we'd still really like it if more students could send us some of =
their artwork! Just send us one or two of your favorite pieces attached =
to a reply in this email and we'll add it to the slideshow.=20

Annnndd we're still looking for musicians! So if you have a friend who's =
a harmonica prodigy or bizarrely good at bagpipes tell them they should =
contact us.=20

Cheers!=20
