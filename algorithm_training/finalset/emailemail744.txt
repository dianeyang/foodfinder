[anime-social] Fwd: Talk about Harvard at your High School!
*VOLUNTEER FOR THE RETURN TO HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAM!*
**
*The Undergraduate Admissions Council is looking for Harvard students to go
back to their high schools (or high schools in their hometown) over Winter
Break to give a presentation about Harvard!*

The Admissions Committee truly relies on current Harvard students to reach
out to high school students and act as a liaison between Harvard and their
communities!

Even if you cannot make a presentation over Winter Break, we still welcome
students who would like to present at another time!

*TRAININGS WILL BE ON WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 5, AND THURSDAY DECEMBER 6, IN
AGASSIZ HOUSE (located in Radcliffe Yard) FROM 6:30-7:30 PM. *

We know that finals are a stressful time for everyone but the training will
be brief (less than an hour!) and we will provide snacks!

*Please note you MUST attend ONE of these two training sessions to
participate! *

*To RSVP, or if you have any questions or concerns, please email
tseery@college.harvard.edu
