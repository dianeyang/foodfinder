Program:_*

The Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Oklahoma is 
seeking highly qualified and motivated applicants for our PhD graduate 
program. The application window is now open for the Fall 2013 entering 
class. We provide full financial support to our students (tuition waiver 
+ stipend + health insurance).
THERE IS NO APPLICATION FEE.

We are seeking applicants interested in experiment and theory in the 
four broad areas of study:

  Astronomy and Astrophysics
  Atomic, Molecular, Optical, and Chemical Physics
  Condensed Matter Physics
  High Energy Physics

Information on our graduate program and research projects can be found at:
http://www.nhn.ou.edu/grad/

Our graduate brochure is also available at:
http://www.nhn.ou.edu/grbroch/OU_PhyAst_Grad_Brochure.pdf

Qualified applicants should have a minimum US equivalent of a BS in 
Physics or in a closely related field. The applicant should have upper 
division physics courses on their academic transcript with US equivalent 
grades of B or higher (e.g. Classical Mechanics, Electricity and 
Magnetism, Quantum Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Statistical Mechanics). 
Research experience is desired, but is not required. The Physics Subject 
GRE exam scores are helpful, but not required. TOEFL/IELTS scores are 
generally required from international applicants for whom English is 
their second language. (see link to FAQ below)

All students are offered full financial support. Typically in the first 
year students are supported on Graduate Teaching Assistantships.

We begin evaluating applications in January for admission the following 
fall. Although we do not have a strict application deadline, we ask that 
students arrange for us to receive all their application materials by 15 
February. Applications are evaluated on a rolling basis through April. 
Late applicants run the risk that we may have filled all the program 
slots for this year.

There is no fee to apply, but you must follow the instructions with the 
application materials.

Instructions and application materials can be found at:

Nebraska's summer program offers research opportunities in the science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. A complete listing of 
faculty mentors and research project descriptions can be found on our 
website ( http://www.unl.edu/summerprogram/ ). Students can also find 
information about program benefits including a competitive stipend, room 
and board, travel expenses, and more.

Summer 2013 programs include:
http://www.unl.edu/summerprogram/research#intro

- Applied Mathematics
- Bioenergy Systems
- Biomedical Engineering
- Chemistry
- Earth and Atmospheric Sciences
- Nanomaterials and Nanoscience
- Optics and Laser Physics
- Redox Biology
- Virology

During the Nebraska Summer Research Program, students receive first-hand 
exposure to research and the experience of graduate school. They work 
closely with faculty mentors and research teams of graduate students and 
other summer scholars. Students also have opportunities to participate 
in meaningful social and professional development activities outside of 
the laboratory.

Our online application makes it easy for students to apply. Priority 
review begins Friday, February 1 and all applications are due Friday, 
February 15. Students historically underrepresented in graduate 
education and students from academic institutions where research 
programs are limited are especially encouraged to apply.
