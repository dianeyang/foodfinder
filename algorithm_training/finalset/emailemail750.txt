[AAA-open] Let's talk about affirmative action
What do you think of when you hear "affirmative action?"
Have you ever judged yourself or a peer because of an
assumption you made about affirmative action?
Have you felt attacked or slighted because of a
comment made about affirmative action?
Affirmative action has been a big topic on campus this year--
what do you have to say about it???

Join the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations for a
discussion on affirmative action and how it impacts our perceptions of
others, particularly our peers in this community. Come share your thoughts o
n how and why our impressions of affirmative action are manifested in our
interactions on campus and beyond
