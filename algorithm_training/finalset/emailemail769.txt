Re: [anime-social] Voting for next semester's shows
So based on the votes, it looks like we'll be watching (a lot of positive
feedback for most of the choices!):

Spice and Wolf (both seasons)
Psycho-Pass
Natsume (1st season)
Oda Nobuna
Kino's Journey
Horizon (1st season)
Hellsing Ultimate

These were all substantially ahead of the other options. Spice and Wolf (*
yes!*), Natsume, and Oda Nobuna were also clear favorites.

That's all for now! We'll start working on some scheduling stuff in a
couple weeks before we get back from break.
