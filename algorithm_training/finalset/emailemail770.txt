[anime-list] Last Tuesday Showing!
We're wrapping up DRRR!! and JF today. It's also the last Tuesday showing
of the semester! Also the last day of classes.

Hope everyone had a good semester :) This is the last "official" meeting,
although technically there's one more Saturday meeting left, which has a
movie up for grabs (we're also finishing up Tiger and Bunny). If anyone
wants to kick back that day, let me know what you'd like to watch!
