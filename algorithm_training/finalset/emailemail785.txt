As you may know, I am a co-founder of No Labels, a group that is doing the
impossible and helping to end gridlock in Washington, DC.****

On January 14, No Labels is hosting a one-of-a-kind event in New York City
called the *Meeting to Make America Work!*, where No Labels will unveil a
new group of problem solvers in Congress -- 30 lawmakers who have committed
to meeting across the aisle -- and two nationally known leaders, one
Republican and one Democrat, of the No Labels effort.****

If you=92re sick of the hyper-partisanship in Washington, like me, this eve=
nt
is for you.****

there and see a man who won't cheat, then you know he never will.=94-John D=
