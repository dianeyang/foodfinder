[AAA-open] Talk about Harvard in your high school!
*VOLUNTEER FOR THE RETURN TO HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAM WITH THE HARVARD
UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS COUNCIL!
*
We are looking for Harvard students to go back to their high schools
(or high schools in their hometown) over Winter Break to give a
presentation about Harvard!

The Admissions Committee truly relies on current Harvard students to reach
out to high school students and act as a liaison between Harvard and their
communities!

Even if you cannot make a presentation over Winter Break, we still welcome
students who would like to present at another time!

*TRAINING WILL BE ON WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 5, AND THURSDAY DECEMBER 6TH, IN
AGASSIZ HOUSE FROM 6:30-7:30 PM. *

*You only need to attend ONE training to participate. **Agassiz House is
located in Radcliffe Yard.*

We know that finals are a stressful time for everyone but the training will
be brief (less than an hour!) and we will provide snacks!

*In order to RSVP, or if you have any questions or concerns, please email
tseery@college.harvard.edu*
