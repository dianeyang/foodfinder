[AAA-open] Stumped on that Secret Snowflake Gift Exchange Gift??
THE PERFECT GIFT FOR....ANYONE! (at the convenient price of $10)

The HARVARD disc.=20

No shipping fee, no tax, no time wasted shopping for a gift in the =
Square.  Just say yes and get an awesome Harvard disc (official 175-g =
Ultrastar) with metallic red print (not one of those cheap, lightweight =
ones). =20

At a great deal of $10 per disc (a similar disc with no logo costs about =
$13). These make great gifts for that person in your club/entryway/house =
who "is really hard to shop for."


If you are interested in purchasing a disc (or two!), please fill out =
this form!!
