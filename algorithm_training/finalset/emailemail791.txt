[HKA] state of racism in korea
http://media.daum.net/foreign/others/newsview?newsid=3D20121205103221646

for those of you who can read korean, please take a moment and read this
article. notice the racialized characterization of the situation put forth
by the "journalist," and read just few of the comments in the comment
section ...

i feel bad for the guy, but the level of racism is appalling and horrendous

the most outrageous one i read was:
=B8=B5=C4=C1=C0=CC =B9=CC=BF=F6=C1=F6=B1=E2 =BD=C3=C0=DB=C7=DF=B4=D9.

RIP.
