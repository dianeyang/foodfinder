Dear Friends,

We write collectively after a group of local Bostonian activists reached
out to one of us regarding an urgent humanitarian cause. As Winter
approaches and war escalates in Syria, the number of Syrian refugees in
neighboring countries has increased to a whopping 440,000+ people according
to the last UNHCR survey announced a week and a half ago. Jordan, host to
many of those refugees, is anticipating one of the coldest winters in
recent times and the biggest sum of refugees there live in impoverished
camps in tents that lack basic heating equipment. The refugees there are in
dire need for winter clothes.

These activists have decided to take action and are collecting warm clothes
to send to the Syrian refugees there before the end of this month. This
group has worked with several local and international relief organizations
to help refugees in both Jordan and Turkey over the past year and a half.
This time, they are working with "Zakat Foundation" which will be arranging
the logistics of getting the donations to the camps in Northern Jordan. The
group is reaching out to college students asking them to donate any clothes
that are gently used and in good shape that they do not need. We would
really appreciate it if you can help us with this cause. If you have any
warm clothes that you can spare, please drop them off in *Kirkland E-12* by
*December 13th*.

Please feel free to forward this message to any lists you are on.
Thank you for your help and Happy Holidays!
