Forwarding for a friend!

This is a spacious 790 square foot railroad-style apartment with 3 separate
rooms. There are 1-2 bedrooms (depending on whether you want to turn the
living room into a bedroom), and 1 bathroom. It also has a fully stocked
eat-in kitchen and dining table that seats four. The middle bedroom has a
queen sized bed that can sleep 2, and the living room/2nd bedroom has a
futon that can sleep up to two. There is tons of storage space, with a
large closet with built in shelving as well as 3 dressers throughout the
apartment. There are also 2 desks as well as a TV with cable set up. The
living room also features a full working fireplace. It is located in an
awesome neighborhood within a block of Serendipity 3, Bloomingdale's, etc.
The landlords live downstairs and are quick to respond to any maintenance
issues. Pictures are below!

The entire apartment is $2330 per month +utilities, with a one month
