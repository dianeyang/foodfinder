*JOIN THE UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS COUNCIL! **VOLUNTEER FOR THE RETURN TO
HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAM!*

*
We are looking for Harvard students to go back to their high schools (or
high schools in their hometown) over Winter Break to give a presentation
about Harvard!
*

The Admissions Committee truly relies on current Harvard students to reach
out to high school students and act as a liaison between Harvard and their
communities!

Even if you cannot make a presentation over Winter Break, we still welcome
students who would like to present at another time!

Our *TRAININGS WILL BE ON WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 5, AND THURSDAY DECEMBER 6TH,
IN AGASSIZ HOUSE (located in Radcliffe Yard) FROM 6:30-7:30 PM. *

We know that finals are a stressful time for everyone but the training will
be brief (less than an hour!) and we will provide snacks!

*
Please note you must attend ONE training to participate!
*

*
In order to RSVP, or if you have any questions or concerns, please email
tseery@college.harvard.edu
