 Dear students,****

The kick-off event for the Cultural Entrepreneurship Challenge, scheduled
for December 6th at the i-lab and featuring Yo Yo Ma and the Silk Road
Ensemble, is drawing a lot of attention and excitement. I understand that
some of you have had trouble registering for the event and am writing to
let you know that we have been able to secure an additional 100 tickets for
the undergraduate population. These will be "special invite" tickets that
can only be accessed via the following link:

Please make sure that you arrive early for the event and that you have your
ticket: there is a cap on the number of people who can attend*; ticket
holders will be checked in first, but a ticket does not guarantee admission=
.

Humanities in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Silk Road

cellist Yo-Yo Ma. Through this multi-faceted partnership, the Challenge
makes the most of the extraordinary talent, ambition, and passion on our
campus and outside to promote cultural enterprises that will address the
problem of declining funding and limited career opportunities in the realms
of art and culture. ****
