[hasa-talk] WINTER HOUSING: Denied housing? Still dont have a place
	to stay?
Hey fam,=0A=0AThis is to reach out especially to underclassmen. If you forg=
ot to apply for winter housing, the deadline is DECEMBER 7th (if I checked =
right) BUT with a penalty fee of $75.=0A=0AIF YOU WERE DENIED housing, plea=
se reach out to your PROCTOR or RESIDENT DEAN/FRESHMEN DEAN OFFICE ASAP=A0a=
nd let them know of your rejection to winter housing. Let them know the exa=
ct reason why you (desperately) need housing, eg flying home is not within =
your budget, etc. This happened to me last year (was denied housing) and wi=
thin a few seconds of chatting with my resident dean, I was approved on spo=
t.=A0=0A=0AIf all the above fail, please LET US (HASAns) KNOW ASAP. Twas on=
ly four years ago that freshmen were absolutely not allowed to apply for wi=
nter housing and the then upperclassmen did well to house their poor young =
siblings :).=0A=0AIn general, DON'T GET STRESSED over winter housing alone.=
 Email hasa list for advice, support, room crashing, etc.=0A=0APeace y'all=
