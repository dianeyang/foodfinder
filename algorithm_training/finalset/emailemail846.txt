[IOP-Announce] Dems-Republican Debate CANCELLED
Dear IOP,

Due to a last minute withdrawal by the Harvard College Democrats, the
Harvard Political Union's Dems-Republican debate on the fiscal cliff has
been CANCELLED.

We're really sorry about this. The scheduling change was beyond the Harvard
Political Union's control.

Best Regards,

Sidhant Misra
Chair, Harvard Political Union
