[Care-list] HCC Election Information!
Hello Care,

Happy Reading Period!  Thank you to everyone who contributed to the 7th
Annual Benefit Dinner & Silent Auction this past Saturday by either
attending, donating, or spreading the word.  The event was a great
success!  Click

read an article in *The Harvard Crimson* about it.

It's hard to believe that the year is coming to end and that it's already
time for elections!  If you are an active member of Harvard China Care, you
are allowed to run and vote.

else in HCC.  Proxy voting is allowed for anyone undergraduates currently
subscribed on Care-list. Attached to the e-mail is the 2013 board
descriptions and the 2013 candidacy statement form.  Please read over the
board descriptions carefully, as some positions will be changed from this
year to next year.

Finally, Robi and I are available for "coffee chats" for anyone who would
like to talk more to us about running for a position.  Feel free to reach
out to us for suggestions, questions, anything!  To meet with either or us,
please e-mail Robi at rcai14@college.harvard.edu or me at
eliu@college.harvard.edu.

We highly encourage all of you to consider running for a position,
especially if you would like to learn more about HCC, become more involved,
or truly want to make a difference.  We look forward to receiving your
nominations and reading your candidacy statements!

Best,
Eden
