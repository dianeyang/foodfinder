[SPS] Write @ 5 Linden January writing space for senior thesis
 writers (and dissertation writers)

I am writing to let you know about*Write @ 5 Linden, *a January writing 
space for senior thesis writersand dissertation writers (flier 
attachedin pdf form). *Write @ 5 Linden* will be open
*Monday through Friday, January 2 through January 25, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
(with the exception of January 18 and 24, when the room is in use for 
other purposes) *

*Write @ 5 Linden**,* in the Bureau of Study Counsel's second floor 
Seminar Room, will provide *company, quiet, coffee, and cookies* in a 
pleasant space with cafe tables and chairs.  While there will be no 
formal workshop or structure, counselors will stop in occasionally to 
check in on how things are going for students, and students are, of 
course, always welcome to make an individual appointment with a Bureau 
counselor for consultation about anything related to their writing 
process and their life asstudents more generally.  We know that students 
often have high hopes for what they can accomplish on their project 
during January but that, on any given day, it can be hard to start 
writing, and a sense of isolation and loneliness can take a toll on 
their staminaand focus.  For those who would welcome company and a 
change of perspective from their room or the library, we hope that 
*Write @ 5 Linden* will serve as an inviting and useful option.  
Students can come and go as they like, and there is no need to 
register.  (Note:  Students who want to return to on-campus 
housing before Winter-sessionbegins on January 18 need to get permission 
to do so.)
Thankyou,
