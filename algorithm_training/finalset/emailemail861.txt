What is H-LAB?

H-LAB is a program that brings Harvard undergraduates to Japan to teach
self-designed liberal arts seminars to Japanese high school students, expos=
ing
them to a liberal arts style of education in the spirit of Harvard's
freshman seminars.  Participants will each be working alongside a Japanese
undergraduate teaching fellow to teach small groups of students in
three-day seminars for a total of six days.  H-LAB gives Japanese high
school students the opportunity to interact with a diverse group of
university students, opening them up to the world beyond their own
communities.  No Japanese is required.


The tentative dates for this year will be August 10-August 24, including an
orientation retreat for university students.


A seminar leader must be able to:


1. Design a seminar in close contact with your teaching fellow

2. Attend training sessions in the spring, as well as aid the H-LAB Harvard
Committee

3. Be a positive role model and ambassador to the high school students
