[Canaday-list] [UAC] IT'S NOT TOO LATE!
VOLUNTEER FOR THE RETURN TO HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAM!

We are looking for Harvard students to go back to their high schools (or =
high schools in their hometown) over Winter Break to give a presentation =
about Harvard!

The Admissions Committee truly relies on current Harvard students to =
reach out to high school students and act as a liaison between Harvard =
and their communities!=20

Even if you cannot make a presentation over Winter Break, we still =
welcome students who would like to present at another time!

Our  LAST TRAINING IS TODAY DEC. 6TH IN AGASSIZ HOUSE (located in =
Radcliffe Yard) FROM 6:30-7:30 PM.=20

We know that finals are a stressful time for everyone but the training =
will be brief (less than an hour!) and we will provide snacks!

Please note you must the training to participate!=20

In order to RSVP, or if you have any questions or concerns, please email =
tseery@college.harvard.edu
