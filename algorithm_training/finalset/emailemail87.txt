Why did Canada decide to legislate a citizenship law in 1946? Why was a sim=
ilar proposal abandoned in 1931? And why was the citizenship law changed in=
 1977? By looking at Canadian parliamentary debates on dual citizenship, we=
 can locate the particular motivations and justifications for constructing =
citizenship laws in Canada. In addition to the symbolic significance of tho=
se laws as representing the country's independence, citizenship laws are en=
acted as a political instrument to achieve immediate and specific goals.
