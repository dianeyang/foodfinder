[SPS] Recipe Book
Do you have any favorite recipes!  We are trying to put together a 
Physics Department recipe booklet for the holidays.  If you have a 
favorite recipe you would like to include, please e-mail it to me, so we 
can add it to our booklet.  Do this, as soon as possible!

Thank you
Carol
