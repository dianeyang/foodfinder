The Chanukah parties in the houses are sponsored by the Jewish House =
Life Project, which provides culturally Jewish engagement opportunities =
across campus in order build and strengthen the individual communities =
within the houses. Through the Jewish House Life Project students can =
receive funding for events in residential houses and dorms, including =
Shabbat dinners, bagel brunches, Passover seders, movie nights, study =
breaks and beyond! To find out more, email Dana@hillel.harvard.edu=
