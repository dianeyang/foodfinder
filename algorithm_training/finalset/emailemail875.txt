 Hi everyone,

Just wanted to remind you about a couple of events tomorrow (Friday) &
Saturday which I'm helping promote in my capacities as a Trustee at *Wheelo=
ck
College* and as a former board member (and big supporter) of the *Asian
Task Force Against Domestic Violence* (ATASK).
**
*Both events feature renowned, pioneering Asian American playwright David
Henry Hwang **(M. Butterfly, Chinglish, FOB),** *who will be coming to
Boston next weekend specially(!) for these two events.  As I mentioned in
my previous e-mail, I'm very excited to be working on Saturday's FREE event
with the dynamic Linda Chin ("cc-ed" on this e-mail), ATASK's President and
a member of the Wheelock Family Theater Advisory Board.
**
*Event Details (more details further below):*
**
*** TOMORROW ** Friday, Dec. 7th (**8pm-11pm), "Chinglish & Champagne
(benefiting ATASK)" **at the **Lyric Stage Company of Boston* - Helping
to launch ATASK's 20th anniversary celebration series.  The benefit
performance will be followed by a reception where ATASK will present Mr.
Hwang with an Honorary Crane Award.  Limited tickets for the play and
reception are available (for $100 minimum donation) on the ATASK

Henry Hwang"* - *at the Wheelock Family Theatre*, 200 Riverway, Boston -
David Henry Hwang will be interviewed onstage by WGBH reporter Jared Bowen
for what promises to be a lively conversation about Mr. Hwang's
perspectives on writing, casting, and inspiring new voices, faces, and
generations to theater.
*This event is FREE*, but RSVPs to development@atask.org are strongly
encouraged.

I hope you can make one or (even better!) BOTH events. They'll both be
incredibly fun as well as great opportunities to support & become more
familiar with two fantastic institutions in the Task Force and Wheelock
College.

Thanks, and hope to see you next weekend!
