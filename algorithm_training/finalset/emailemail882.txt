[AAA-open] Fwd: [Hraaa-steercom] subway tragedy
Hi AAA,

I've always thought there are better uses for this list than spam. Here's a
good chance to test that out.
Opening this discussion to the greater community in hopes of hearing
different perspectives and articulating a responsible stance as
a community. I'm interested in hearing what you think.

Best,
kevin

I'm absolutely down. One of the things someone mentioned was using AAA-open
to share the great discussions we have on steercom. So please, do it.
