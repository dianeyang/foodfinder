[Canaday-list] URGENT! CHANUKAH!
Canaday C,

I am so proud to announce that the first floor is now not 20% Jewish (me)
but now 60% Jewish!!!!!!!!! Jesus and Mark have put on Yamukah's and have
said something (idk what) in Hebrew...w/e Mark tries to say in Hebrew, he
just gargles the words and says its Hebrew...close enough. Please make them
feel welcome and don't be annoyed if they don't call u on Fri or Sat
because they are observing Shabbat now  and are focusing on "settling down
with a nice Jewish girl" (old Jewish Grandmother voice). But they are
looking to celebrate Chanuakah with Canaday C this year so come by and
party with them, drink (Manushevets), gamble (gelt and dredels), and rage
for 8 NIGHTS STRAIGHT! (quietly though because it's study break). K this
e-mail is too long and nonsensical and I realize as I finish writing it
that I probably should not submit it. But it's funny so enjoy! Night!

Jacob
