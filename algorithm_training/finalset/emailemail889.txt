DESCRIPTION of SHIFTS
******************************
**********************
There are 4 shifts:

Dinner: 6:45 PM - 9:15 PM
Evening: 9:00 PM - 11:15 PM
Overnight: 11 PM - 9:00 AM
Breakfast: 6:30 AM - 9:00 AM

*But if it is SATURDAY morning, then it is*
[Friday] Overnight: 11 PM - 10:00 AM
[Saturday] Breakfast: 7:30 AM - 10:00 AM

BREAKFAST -- Come in bright and early to greet our guests as they begin to
wake up!  You'll be making breakfast and helping to clean the shelter (an
invaluable service!) after all the guests leave at 8am.

DINNER -- You'll be making and serving dinner, and perhaps be lucky enough
to run on a food salvage trip or collect pastries from the many shops that
donate to us.

EVENING -- This is a relaxed time to visit with guests as they prepare for
bed.  It's usually very quiet and a great opportunity for some wonderful
conversations.  Help is also often needed in the kitchen to clean-up after
dinner and prepare plates of food to hand out at the door.

OVERNIGHT =96 You'll hang out with other volunteers and night-owl guests,
basically having more good conversations, watching movies, doing laundry,
reading, baking cookies, etc!  This is a fantastic shift because it's a
rare opportunity to have long conversations and get to know people well.
Overnight volunteers often say it's the best shift!  And never fear, we do
take turns sleeping -- the night is typically divided into three sub-shifts
and you will be asleep for two of them (there is a staff room with bunk
beds, so you will be able to sleep 5-6 hours when it is not your turn to be
awake).

*The shelter is located at 66 Winthrop Street in the basement of the
University Lutheran Church in Harvard Square (on the corner of Dunster and
Winthrop Streets, next to the MAC and Pinocchio's Pizza).
