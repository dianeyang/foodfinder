Informal discussion on the Asian American experience at Harvard. Panelists
will share about their time at Harvard with a focus on three central
themes: 1) academic experience: Has your upbringing affected your choice of
academic pursuits? What advice do you have on "succeeding" in an
environment like Harvard? 2) Extracurriculars: What have you learned from
being a leader in the Asian American community? How has your culture
affected your extracurricular involvements? and finally, 3) Social life:
Has being Asian American influenced your social circle? What advice do you
have for navigating the social scene at Harvard, especially for Asian
Americans?

Following the panel's thoughts, there will be an audience discussion
portion of the event. Please let us know if you have other topics that you
wish to cover!
