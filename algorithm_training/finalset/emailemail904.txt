[Ventures] New Harvard Start-Up Helps You Raise Money For Charity
 In 10 Seconds Without Spending A Cent
Hey guys,

Many thanks to the venture and entrepreneur communities here that have been
such a help in starting our company. We launched last night and want to
share more about us:


Want to help two amazing charities without spending a cent or even a minute
of your time?

Twecare is a new service that helps you do just that. Instead of donating
money, you donate a facebook status and our sponsor, another Harvard
start-up called Ten Groups, donates $1 for every post this week. We've
already raised $100 so far and would really love your help to hit our goal
of $200.

 http://twecare.org <http://bit.ly/RHMVKI> is the link to the site, check
it out!

We're raising money for Harlem RBI, an education organization based in New
York City, and Worldwide Orphans, which runs community healthcare centers
for children around the world.


Thanks!

Best,

Ben and Jake
