Dear Colleague,

Cornell University is very pleased to host the 8th Annual Northeast 
Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics (NCUWiP) in January 
2013. The application site is now open www.ncuwp.org 
<http://www.ncuwp.org/>* and _closes November 15, 2012 with in 11 
days._*  We ask that you advertise the conference among your physics 
majors, encourage them to apply, and help support them to attend if they 
are accepted to the conference.


The conference will start with a welcome reception Friday evening, 
January 18, 2013, and end Sunday afternoon, January 20. The conference 
will be hosted jointly with sister conferences at  Caltech, Colorado 
School of Mines, U of Central Florida, U of Illinois and U of Texas at 
Austin. The keynote presentation will be given by Professor Margaret 
Murnane, an internationally recognized optical and laser scientist at CU 
Boulder, and will be webcast to all six regional conferences.


The conference at Cornell will bring together successful female 
physicists and over 110 undergraduate women in physics to highlight 
opportunities for women in physics and the scientific contributions of 
women in physics. The meeting will provide ample opportunities for 
interacting with fellow physicists. The conference will include the 
following activities:


?Experts from various physics fields
?Tours of premier research facilities at Cornell
?Representatives from industry, summer REU, and graduate school programs
?Career building workshops including advice for international students
?110 other undergraduate women in physics

*Don?t miss out on this amazing opportunity to inspire the future women 
leaders in physics.*



Lodging and meals will be provided for participants who are accepted to 
the conference. Physics departments are_strongly encouraged_to provide 
support for travel for their own students so that conference funds can 
be used to provide travel support where the need is greatest. The number 
of applicants has risen sharply in recent years, so your department's 
support is crucial so that we can accept the largest number of students 
possible to attend this conference.


We are attaching a poster, which we hope you will post in a prominent 
place. Please also circulate this announcement to students in your 
department.
